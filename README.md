# Symptotic Analysis of Autoencoder Architectures for Image Colorization and Noise Reduction

### Course Project - DS 303 - Machine Learning - Spring Semester 2022

*Abstract â€” The goal of this study is to examine the various
methods, algorithms and paradigms that we can derive from neural networks, 
specifically shallow Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), 
to colorise images and create noise free image reproductions.
This project focuses on the Autoencoder architecture, 
which is usually a shallow hourglass shaped neural
network implementation, with limited number of trainable
parameters. This architecture can prove vital for Image Colorization and Noise Reduction
applications in cases of computational hardware limitations. We also
try to examine and contrast the performance of Autoencoders
and PCA for noise reduction.*
